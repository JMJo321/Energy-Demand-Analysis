## The Impact of Time-Of-Use Pricing on How Households Control Their Electricity Consumption for Heating



### Introduction



### Literature

- Low Peak Demand Elasticities under Dynamic Rates
- Two Types of Information Problems
  - Households are likely to be ignorant of their marginal consumption of electricity service
  - Household may not know the price they face
- Rational or Irrational Inattention to the Information about Consumption and Prices
  - The Cost of Acquiring the Information
  - The Cost of Adjustment
- The Impact of Home Automation Technologies on Peak Demand Elasticities
  - The Importance of Default Technology Settings
- Limited Empirical Evidence of Load Shifting



### Data



- Description of Commission for Energy Regulation's (CER's) Customer Behavior Trials
- Balance between Control and Treatment
- Spatial Distribution of Temperature in Ireland
- The Relationship between Heating Degree Days (HDDs) and Household Electricity Consumption



### Estimation

- Difference-In-Differences Estimator



### Results

- Summary of Results
  - The Impact of Time-Of-Use (TOU) Rates on (Rate-Period-Level) Household Electricity Consumption for Heating
    - In terms of Average Treatment Effect
    - In terms of Temperature Control
    - Heterogeneity in the Treatment Effect across:
      - Consumption Level during the Baseline Period
      - Income
      - Square Footage
      - Etc.
  - No Empirical Evidence of Load Shifting
- Implications of the Treatment Effect, especially in terms of Temperature Control
  - TOU vs. Other Dynamic Rates with Higher Granularity, such as Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) and Real-Time Pricing (RTP)
    - Regarding the Costs of  Acquiring Information
  - Heterogeneity in the Treatment Effect
    - Reductions in Net Private Benefits
    - Implication with respect to Energy Poverty
