							MSHR_ENHANCED.TXT

The Enhanced Master Station History Report is a list of basic, historical information for every station in the station history 
database.  The Enhanced MSHR version contains similar data elements and is in a similar format as the Standard/Legacy MSHR, but 
the Enhanced MSHR includes additional stations that are included in the GHCN-Daily dataset. Also, the Enhanced MSHR will 
incorporate additional station networks, including international stations/networks in the future.  The Enhanced MSHR additionally 
contains an expanded number of items such as station status, additional IDs, alternate station names, NWS region, NWS WFO, all elevations, 
latitude/longitude precision and source, and UTC offset.  Data elements are in user-friendly formats.

The file is sorted by source, source_id, begin_date, end_date.

This report is scheduled to be updated monthly.

*** UPDATE, beginning with August 2014 report: New GHCNM-LT source, new columns appended: GHCNMLT_ID, COUNTY_FIPS_CODE, DATUM_HORIZONTAL, 
	DATUM_VERTICAL, LAT_LON_SOURCE.

*** UPDATE, beginning with June 2016 report: New IGRA2 source, new columns appended: IGRA_ID, HPD_ID.
